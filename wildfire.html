      <h2>What is a Wildfire?</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A fast-spreading, uncontrolled fire that burns in forests, grasslands, or other natural areas, often caused by dry conditions, lightning, or human activity. Wildfires are unplanned fires that burn in natural areas like forests, grasslands or prairies. These dangerous fires spread quickly and can devastate not only wildlife and natural areas, but also communities. Wildland fire can be a friend and a foe. In the right place at the right time, wildland fire can create many environmental benefits, such as reducing grass, brush, and trees that can fuel large and severe wildfires and improving wildlife habitat. In the wrong place at the wrong time, wildfires can wreak havoc, threatening lives, homes, communities, and natural and cultural resources.</p>
