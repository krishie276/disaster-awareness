      <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">An earthquake is a sudden and violent shaking of the ground caused by movements within the Earth's crust, usually along fault lines where tectonic plates meet. These shifts release energy that radiates outward, causing the earth to shake. Earthquakes can also be triggered by volcanic eruptions or man-made activities like mining and drilling.

        The strength of an earthquake is measured in two main ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnitude</li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">- This refers to how strong the earthquake is. It's commonly measured using the Richter scale or the more modern Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). The higher the number, the stronger the quake.
        
            <li>Intensity</li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">- This describes how much the ground shakes and how people experience the quake. It's measured using an Intensity Scale, which ranges from 1 (a small unnoticable shaking) to 10 being almost complete destruction .</p>
        </ul>

      <h3>‚úÖ Before an Earthquake:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure heavy furniture and appliances to walls.</li>
        <li>Identify safe spots like under sturdy tables or against interior walls.</li>
        <li>Prepare an emergency kit with food, water, flashlight, and first aid supplies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚úÖ During an Earthquake:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On ‚Äî get under a sturdy object and protect your head and neck.</li>
        <li>Stay away from windows, mirrors, and heavy objects.</li>
        <li>Do not run outside during shaking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚úÖ After an Earthquake:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check yourself and others for injuries.</li>
        <li>Expect aftershocks ‚Äî stay alert.</li>
        <li>Inspect your home for gas leaks or structural damage before re-entering.</li>
      </ul>
